# 🧃 Soda Machine - Python OOP Project

This is a **console-based Soda Vending Machine** simulation built in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It allows users to select different drinks, handles payments, checks resources, and provides a report of available ingredients.

## 🚀 Features

- Structured using multiple **Python classes and modules**
- Supports drinks like `cola`, `lemonade`, `orange fizz`, etc.
- Simulates coin-based **payment system**
- Tracks and updates **resources** (water, soda, lemon juice, sugar syrup, ice)
- Includes special commands:
  - `report` → see available resources
  - `off` → shut down the machine
